# Install the package lmbench
# configure the system with:
cd /usr/lib/lmbench/scripts
./config-run

# remember to select only the "hardware" benchmarks and to set the amount of memory to
# something not too big (2GB is enough, i.e. 2048 MB)
# the command above will create a configuration file in 
# /usr/lib/lmbench/bin/x86_64-linux-gnu/CONFIG.<hostname>

# the benchmarks can then be run with:
systemd-run --wait -p CPUAffinity=X lmbench-run
# where X is the CPU you want to run on

# results are then stored in /var/lib/lmbench/results/x86_64-linux-gnu
