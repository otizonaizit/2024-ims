As an exercise, write the docstring for the `make_python_expert` function you just wrote. 

For a more detailed description, see: https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html

Commit your documenatation and update your pull request.

If you are done, think about which parts of the brewing package should be documented and in what way.
